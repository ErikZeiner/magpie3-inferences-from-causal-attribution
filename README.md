# material for experiment on preference inference from causal attribution 

This repository contains material for a project on pragmatic inferences drawn from causal attribution statements.

## Experiments

All experiments are online experiments, implemented in [magpie](https://magpie-experiments.org/).

To run an experiment locally, set up the project with `npm install` (in the experiment directory).

To run the project locally, run `npm run serve`

### Exp1: Prescriptive norm inference

The experiment is designed to investigate inferences that listeners may draw about the prescriptive norms a speaker may adhere to while controlling for the statistical norm and the subjective likeability of the outcomes.

### Exp2: Statistical norm inference in the absence of prescriptive norms
