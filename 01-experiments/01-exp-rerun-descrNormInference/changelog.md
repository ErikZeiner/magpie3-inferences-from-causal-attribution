In the second run of Experiment 1, we made slight adjustments to the text and images used. 
The description of the marble machine in the pilot experiment contained a repeated word error, where `the' was accidentally typed twice in a row.
Similarly, the text in the pilot incorrectly stated which color marble was released from each compartment after an islander pressed the button on the marble machine.
And finally, the labels in the images accompanying the description of the marble machine's possible states were changed from `left/right urn' to `left/right compartment' to better reflect the textual description. 
Experiments 2 and 3 correspond to the modified text and images from the second run of Experiment 1.
